  * Handles the game logic for a Tic-Tac-Toe board, including user interactions, game state updates, and computer moves.
     *
     * Key Components:
     * 1. Board State Variables and Maps:
     *    - Maintains the current state of the board, including player moves and available slots.
     *    - Maps button IDs to board positions for efficient lookups.
     *
     * 2. On User Click:
     *    - Locate the position of the clicked button on the board using the button's view ID.
     *    - If the button corresponds to a valid position:
     *       - Update the button UI (color and text) to reflect the user's move ("X").
     *       - Perform the following checks:
     *         - **Remove the button's position from the list of available slots.**
     *         - **Check for a win condition:**
     *             - If the user has won:
     *                 - Display a toast message indicating the win.
     *                 - Reset the game state.
     *         - **Check for a draw condition:**
     *             - If the board is full with no winner:
     *                 - Display a toast message indicating a draw.
     *                 - Reset the game state.
     *         - **If no win or draw, initiate the computer's turn.**
     *
     * 3. Computer Play:
     *    - Analyze the board to identify the user's potential next winning move.
     *    - If a winning move for the user is detected:
     *       - Block the user by selecting that position.
     *    - If no blocking is needed:
     *       - Randomly select a position from the available slots.
     *    - Update the board with the computer's move ("O").
     *    - Perform the same state checks as above (win/draw/reset).
     *
     * Game Flow:
     * - Alternates between the user's turn and the computer's turn until a win, draw, or reset occurs.
